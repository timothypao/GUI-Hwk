# GUI-Registration-Form

A responsive and dynmaic registration form written entirely in Python utilizing the Python GUI toolkit: tkinter.

Once the user clicks on the register button, the program validates the user's input to make sure:
1) gender is selected
2) both checkboxes are checked
3) the password and re-type password input match up
4) the password is masked (utilizing "*****")
